# D&D-Inspired Text Adventure Game

This project is a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) inspired text adventure game where the player progresses through 10 steps, including encounters such as gearing up, exploring a dungeon, and battling a dragon. The game uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the narrative and control NPCs, with AI-generated visuals accompanying the story. The playerâ€™s choices determine the progression of the story.
